## Goals


—Include an introductory storypoint introducing your data and case.

Start out with the exploratory analysis you conducted at the beginning of the Achievement. This served as your main guidelines for everything else you completed in the Achievement. You could also include some of your early research questions that guided you through your exploratory analysis.

—Pick out the hypothesis and/or a question you’ll explore and make this the pivot of your story.

—Show the results of the various analyses you conducted. These results don’t have to have been valid—show them simply to provide evidence for why you chose a different approach, similar to the example in the Exercise.

—Include interpretations for each of your analyses’ results.

—Create a summary that states how your results are useful based on the initial research questions and hypothesis.

—Propose next steps for further analysis.

—Include some limitations of your study.
